                    <h1>&lt;/About Me&gt;</h1>
                    <p>After moving to Oregon at 10 years old, Samuel Ellis (b.2002) fell in love with music through middle school band. Playing the Bass Clarinet, he was able to explore the vast world of classical music, performing in orchestras and small chamber ensembles all throughout high school. After graduation, and a brief gap year due to the pandemic, he would continue his musical endevours at the University of Oregon, pursuing Bachelor's degrees in both Computer Science and Music Technology.</p>

				<div class="content2">
                    <p>While at U of O, Samuel was able to learn about the intersection of STEM and music, discovering audio programming and data sonfication. Through working with his professors Jeffrey Stolet and Jon Bellona, he was able to develop skills in software such as Max/MSP, Kyma, and Ableton. This resulted in a wide range of projects including New Media sound design, electronic compositions, and the development of data driven instruments. He also highlighted the accessibility implications of music technology. Through working with Michal Young, Samuel was able to aid in adapting pre-existing Python assignments with sonification, providing accessibility to a visually impaired undergraduate student. This project highlighted how reliant computer science learning is to visual pedagogy, and Samuel has since written a research paper accentuating the benefits of including data sonification in STEM learning.</p>
