                            <p>Through the TV explores the experience I had growing up transgender. I remember during the first stages of discovering my identity, deeply struggling with how I would be perceived, and in turn, struggling with accepting my future as a minority. I remember using media entertainment as a distraction, trying to ignore my own inner turmoil, but even then I was bombarded with hateful messages and propaganda. I am extremely lucky to have resources and a support system that carried me out of this difficult time in my life. However, most transgender youth do not, and the experience of living a life full of hatred is far too normal. This piece showcases my story and I hope that it gives confidence to trans kids today. It does in fact get better.</p>

                            <p>I was introduced to the film Spirited Away by my partner Aspen Denney. Wanting to expand my skills in audio recording, I thought that this piece exploring the film’s main theme would be a perfect fit. My wonderful friends brought this piece to life using three soprano clarinets and one bass clarinet. I added the addition of ambient sounds in order to match the nature-esc imagery Studio Ghibli films provide.</p>

                            <p>Lampscape is my first exploration into the development of data-driven instruments. The piece was inspired by Christmas light shows that I saw with my family as a child. I wondered if it would be possible to have a musical performance where instead of audio synchronized lights, lights would control audio output. Using Max/MSP’s Jitter functions, the following piece uses a light tracking program to control MIDI and audio sample outputs in Ableton.</p>

                            <p>440 Hz is based on my experience going to my first professional orchestra concert. I remember the ambient hall, hearing the musicians practice small excerpts along with the shuffling of paper and stands on stage. I recall the sea of patrons, conversing quietly while trying to find their seats. Immersed and excited for the upcoming performance, I almost didn’t notice the concertmaster appear and begin tuning the ensemble.</p>
                            <p>The mass of sound that arose from every instrument, in every direction, filled the hall. Timbres bounced off each other and overtones created harmonies in space. The simple unified pitch of “A” created a beautiful soundscape, rapturing the attention of everyone in the audience. This frequency wasn’t just a tuning note, it was a prelude to what was about to come.</p>
                            <p>440 Hz explores the expansion of this simple tuning exercise, highlighting interwoven harmonies of acoustic instruments. The paired graphic score visualizes the movement of these overtones, showcasing how a single pitch can be reimagined and altered over time.</p>

When this particular title was re-released for the Nintendo Switch, I was brought back to my childhood, re-falling in love with a world full of magic and beauty. As tribute, I remade the following trailer’s sound design, including an original arrangement of the game’s main theme, using instruments that reflect the game’s story.</p>
